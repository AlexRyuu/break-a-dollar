Algorithm Overview

Here is the logic for figuring out how many ways there are to create 25 cents using
only quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. The logic to solve this is the same logic
needed to figure out how many ways there are to break a dollar.

Here is a quick reference for people unfamiliar with American coins.
Q = Quarter (25 cents)
D = Dime    (10 cents)
N = Nickel  ( 5 cents)
P = Penny   ( 1 cent)

This table lists every way to create 25 cents.
Q   D   N   P
--------------
0   0   0   25
0   0   1   20
0   0   2   15
0   0   3   10
0   0   4   05
0   0   5   00
0   1   0   15
0   1   1   10
0   1   2   05
0   1   3   00
0   2   0   05
0   2   1   00
1   0   0   00

This pseudo-code outlines the algorithm.
fullAmount = 25
loop Q from 0 to fullAmount/25:

    remainingAmount = fullAmount - (25 * Q)
    loop D from 0 to remainingAmount/10:

        remainingAmount = remainingAmount - (10 * D)
        loop N from 0 to remainingAmount/5:

            remainingAmount = remainingAmount - (5 * N)
                // there's only one way to create a value using pennies
